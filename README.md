## smugglEX: <i>A Mock NEXT.js (v13) Web Application for Testing DevSecOps Pipelines</i>

smugglEX is a purpose-built mock web application designed to simulate real-world web application vulnerabilities. It serves as an invaluable tool for testing and validating the effectiveness of DevSecOps pipelines. The application is built using NEXT.js (v13), a popular JavaScript framework for server-rendered React applications.

The primary objective of smugglEX is to provide a safe environment for DevSecOps teams to evaluate the security measures and robustness of their pipelines. By emulating common web application vulnerabilities, it allows organizations to proactively identify and address potential security flaws before they can be exploited in a real-world scenario.

Features:
- CRUD Functionality: smugglEX offers a straightforward user interface that enables users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on items stored in a database.
- Vulnerability Simulation: The application deliberately incorporates various security vulnerabilities, showcasing common attack vectors such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and more. These vulnerabilities can be leveraged to assess the effectiveness of security testing tools and automation pipelines.
- Realistic Environment: smugglEX mimics the behavior and structure of a typical web application, providing an authentic testing ground for DevSecOps pipelines. It closely resembles the architecture and components commonly encountered in real-world applications.

Usage:
1. Clone the smugglEX repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the application by executing `npm run dev`.
4. Access the application through your preferred web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

We highly encourage users to thoroughly test their DevSecOps pipelines against smugglEX and actively contribute to its improvement. Your feedback and contributions are invaluable in enhancing the security posture of web applications.

**Disclaimer:** Please be aware that smugglEX intentionally incorporates vulnerabilities that could potentially compromise the security of your system. It is crucial to only use smugglEX within controlled environments and exercise caution while handling sensitive data.

## DevSecOps Checklist

- [ ] Implement a Continuous Integration (CI) system (e.g., Jenkins).
- [ ] Implement code quality and static analysis checks (e.g., SonarQube).
- [ ] Implement secure coding standards (e.g., OWASP Top 10, CWE/SANS Top 25).
- [ ] Implement regular vulnerability scanning (e.g., Snyk).
- [ ] Perform Static Application Security Testing (SAST) (e.g., Fortify, Veracode).
- [ ] Perform Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite).
- [ ] Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.
- [ ] Establish a Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD).
- [ ] Containerize applications using Docker.
- [ ] Orchestrate containers using Kubernetes or Amazon ECS.
- [ ] Implement monitoring and log management solutions (e.g., Prometheus, ELK Stack).
- [ ] Have an incident response plan and utilize Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack).
- [ ] Ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR).
- [ ] Perform regular audit and compliance management activities (e.g., ServiceNow, RSA Archer).
